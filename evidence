### Authorization Enforcement Test

Attempted to register a resource provider using a Reader-scoped user:

az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights

Code: AuthorizationFailed
Message: The client 'USERB' with object id '56000......' does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/register/action' over scope '/subscriptions/10xxxxxxxxxxxxx' or the scope is invalid
